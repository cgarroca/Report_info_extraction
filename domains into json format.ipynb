       "['ANNEX 2 - CLASSIFICATION OF STATISTICAL ACTIVITIES (CSA REV. 1) \\n \\nEXPLANATORY NOTES \\n(October 2009) \\n \\n1. The Classification of Statistical Activities (CSA) is used to classify the statistical \\nactivities undertaken by national and international statistical organizations. It is used as \\nthe basis for the Database of International Statistical Activities1, and for the list of \\nsubject matter domains in the Content-oriented Guidelines, produced by the SDMX \\n(Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange) initiative.  \\n \\n2. The classification has three levels. The five “domains” form the first level, and \\nrelate to the broad type of statistical activities. The second level specifies “activities” \\nwithin these domains and the third level covers more detailed “subject areas”. The third \\nlevel is used only where necessary, and is not meant to provide an exhaustive \\nbreakdown of an “activity”. \\n \\n3. Domains 1 to 3 relate to subject-matter activities, typically resulting in data \\noutputs, but also including methodological work aimed at developing or revising \\nstandards, and activities related to technical cooperation or training specific to a subject \\narea. Domains 4 and 5 cover substantive cross-cutting issues which do not relate \\ndirectly to outputs, but are more process and organization oriented (e.g. general census \\nor survey methodology, statistical coordination, statistical information systems, etc.). \\n \\n1. Demographic and social statistics \\n1.1 Population and migration \\n Population and migration – covers work in population and demographic statistics, \\ntopics like demography, vital statistics, population structures and growth, \\ndemographic projections, families and households (marriages, divorces, household \\nsize), migration, refugees and asylum seekers.  \\nExcludes \\n– causes of death (1.4) \\n  \\n1.2 Labour \\n Labour – covers statistics on labour force, labour market, employment and \\nunemployment; the more detailed topics include economically active population, \\nlabour conditions, health and safety at work (accidents at work, occupational injuries \\nand diseases, work-related health problems), working time and other working \\nconditions, strikes and lockouts, job vacancies, job creation.  \\nExcludes  \\n– migrant workers (1.1) \\n– unemployment insurance and unemployment benefits (1.6) \\n– trade union membership (1.10) \\n– unpaid work (1.11) \\n– statistics on earnings, wages and salaries (2.8) \\n– labour cost (2.8) \\n  \\n                                                 \\n1 http://unece.unog.ch/disa \\n\\n1.3 Education \\n Education – includes educational participation, illiteracy, educational institutions and \\nsystems, human and financial resources invested in education, lifelong learning, \\nvocational training and adult learning, impact of education, assessments of student \\nperformance, etc. \\n  \\n1.4 Health \\n Health – covers the health and mortality related statistical activities, including topics \\nlike life expectancy, health status, health and safety, health determinants (including \\nlifestyle, nutrition, smoking, alcohol abuse), health resources and expenditure, health \\ncare systems, morbidity and mortality (including infant and child mortality), hospital \\nadmission, causes of illness and death, specific diseases (e.g. AIDS), disabilities, \\npharmaceutical consumption and sales, health personnel, remuneration of health \\nprofessions, environmental health status, health inequality, health accounts. \\nExcludes  \\n– work related health and safety (1.2)  \\n– victimisation from criminal behaviour (1.8) \\n– traffic accidents and injuries (2.4.4) \\n  \\n1.5 Income and consumption \\n Income and consumption – covers statistics on household income and expenditures \\nfrom household viewpoint (all types of income and expenditure), including topics like \\ndistribution of incomes, in-kind income, income transfers received and paid, income- \\nor expenditure-based measures of poverty, consumer protection, consumption \\npatterns, consumer goods and durables, household wealth and debts. \\nExcludes  \\n– social protection schemes against various risks (1.6) \\n– tax schemes (2.5) \\n– poverty in a multidimensional sense (3.3.1)  \\n– living conditions (3.3.1) \\n– social inclusion/exclusion (3.3.1) \\n  \\n1.6 Social protection \\n Social protection – deals with statistics on measures to protect people against the \\nrisks of inadequate incomes associated with unemployment, ill health, invalidity, old \\nage, parental responsibilities, or inadequate income following the loss of a spouse or \\nparent, etc., includes statistics on pension beneficiaries, social security schemes, \\nsocial protection expenditure, etc. \\nExcludes  \\n– insurance companies as economic actors (2.4.6) \\n– pension funds as actors in financial markets(2.4.6)  \\n  \\n1.7 Human settlements and housing \\n Human settlements and housing – covers statistical activities on housing, dwellings \\nand human settlements \\nExcludes  \\n– rents (2.7) \\n  \\n\\n   \\n1.8 Justice and crime \\n Justice and crime – activities including crime, convictions, operation of criminal \\njustice systems, justice, safety, victims, clear-up rates, prison population, illicit drug \\nproduction, trafficking and use, etc.  \\n \\n1.9 Culture \\n Culture – statistics dealing with cultural activities in society, like theatre, cinemas, \\nmuseums, libraries, mass media, book production, sports, etc., including expenditure \\nand financing of culture. \\n  \\n1.10 Political and other community activities \\n Political and other community activities – statistics on voting turnout, participation in \\npolitical and other community activities, trade union membership, social dialogue, \\ncivil society, social capital, etc.  \\n \\n1.11 Time use \\n Time-use – statistics on the use of time by individuals, often related to work-life \\nbalance (reconciling family responsibilities and paid work); unpaid work.  \\nExcludes  \\n– working time (1.2) \\n  \\n2.
